===== Dialogs module Release Notes =====

This file contains a detailled summary of Dialogs module evolution.

For more details, please refer to the GIT log.

Dialogs 0.6 - 19/10/2011
========================

Major new features:
-------------------

- concepts that are currently manipulated are marked as 'ActiveConcept' in
  the ontology. This allows for instance dynamic vizualisation of the
  grounding process.
- added infrastructure to assess the grammatical validity of a sentence
- added mechanism to render sentences with different formatter
  (included coloured tty + CSS ones)
- termination sentences (like 'goodbye') are recognized and Dialogs exits.
- added optional support of speech recognition via gSpeet (python bindings
  for the Google Speech recognition API)
- Dialogs now uses the new KB API of oro-server ('revise' action + policies)

Language features:
------------------

- Support for 'ALL' quantification
- Better support for 'SOME' quantification (when several candidates are
  available, a random one is picked)
- Fixed handling of "this" + category (the category was previously ignored)
- Added support for "in front of" construct
- Added support for "everything" ('everything' is currently equivalent to
  'all artifacts')/"anything"
- Some irregular nouns and adjectives have been added
- Some thematic roles have been added ('clean', 'look', 'uncover')

Grounding features:
-------------------

- Added a visibility check in the discrimination routine
- When an agent expresses a state, use an indirection with 'experience'.
  For instance: I'm cold -> [myself experience GD3s3, GD3s3 hasFeature cold]

Other new features:
-------------------

- host/port of the ontology server is not hardcoded anymore (!)
- fixed UTF8 issues
- continuous refactoring of the code
  - preprocessor and parser are now splitted
- fixed some logging issues
- added a failfast options for the unittests + a diff with expected results
- added a 'demo' generator that output parsing unittest to HTML
- lots of small bug fixes
- completed the documentation with more examples from the user-study and
  main algorithms
  
  
Dialogs 0.5 - 09/02/2011
========================
 
- Renaming from dialog to dialogs

Dialogs 0.4 - 25/01/2011
========================

- added special command 'forget it' to leave an interaction
- handle 'to know':
    - for instance, 'do you know the red bottle?'
	- 'what object do you know?'
	- 'i know the yellow banana'
- added a 'demo' mode that wait between each step (except it doesn't
because I couldn't find a way to actually wait for a keypress... cf commit
4cba0223)
- better processing of directions
- parsing support for more temporal preposistions (as soon as, until...)
- added 'X is Y' -> 'X sameAs Y'
- added the ability to 'teach' new concepts (commit f693602e):
  -> 'Learn that the bottle is on the table'
- more work on the merge function (when the human complete the informations)
- parsing (but no futher handling) of time data (months, days...)
- added an explicit 'SentenceFactory' to easily build common sentences like
questions
- added verb 'to think to' in the list of known verbs

and as usual, tenth of bug fixes :-)


Dialogs 0.3 - 08/09/2010
========================

The "Moving to London" scenario pass!

Dialogs 0.2 - 12/08/2010
========================

Main features:
--------------
    - input/output module to chat with the robot
    - grammar-free parsing module for English natural language (NL)
    - verbalizing module to reconstruct a NL sentence
    - glue-ing chat module with parser + verbalizer
    - resolution of personal references + anaphors
    - resolution noun phrases (= identification of concepts)
    - resolution action verbs based on thematic roles (dictionnary-based)
    - content analysis (done for imperative sentences, statements, questions)
    - statement builder (convert a parsed sentence into RDF statements)
    - question handler (for question, try to answer them with ORO)
    - glue-ing parsing + resolution + analysis + handling
    
Other features:
---------------
    - handling of groups with only an adjective
    - "this bottle is 'next to' the table" -> pre-processing to replace "next to" by "next+to"
    - Running dialog even if no ontology server.
    - Generate "subclassOf" statements:
        E.g: Apples are Fruits
            E.g: an Apple is a fruit
            - Manage Verb Tense in a naive way ("I went to Toulouse" -> [event1205 eventOccurs PAST]).
            - Process adverbs ("I go slowly to Toulouse" -> [event1205 actionSupervisionMode SLOW])
            - Process quantifiers: some, all, digits (1,2,3...), none
            - Handling of conjunctions (AND, OR)
            - pre content-analysis -> "what color is the tape?" -> don't use the color to discriminate
            - use 'safeAdd' method to detect the inconsistencies
            - Coloured output for easy explaination of the Dialog module behaviour
