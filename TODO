Dialog TODO list for release 1.0
================================

Bugs
----
[TODO] method 'check(Set)' on server always returns 'True'
    Useful for questionHandler for processing Yes-No question

[ONGOING] "close the loop" -> parser should be able to complete a previously, partially resolved, sentence.
    with method remerge in sentence.py
    
[DONE] sentence pre-processing (punctuation, term expansion, capital letters...)
[DONE] Turn everything to English
[DONE] Clarify which members of sentence are list, which are single element. 
    map: [A] means list of A
	Sentence (data_type, aim, sn, sv):
		data_type:	string	
		aim:		string
		sn: 		[Nominal_Group]
		sv:	    	[Nominal_Group]
	
	Nominal_Group(det, noun, adj, noun_cmpl, relative):
		det:		[string]
		noun:		[string]
		adj:		[string]
		noun_cmpl:	[Nominal_Group]
        relative:   [sentence]
        
    Verbal_Group(vrb_main, sv_sec, vrb_tense, d_obj, i_cmpl, advrb, vrb_adv, vrb_sub_sentence, state):
        state:              string
        vrb_tense:          string
        vrb_main:           [string]
        advrb:              [string]
        vrb_adv:            [string]
        d_obj:              [Nominal_Group]
        i_cmpl:             [Indirect_Object([string], [Nominal_Group])]
        sv_sec:             [Verbal_Group]
        vrb_sub_sentence:   [sentence]
        

	
	Also: If we have several nouns, e.g "toto" and "tata", we create a new nominal group, even though this results to several single-element lists.

[DONE] Sort out the "flags": at least, convert it to a map, maybe, remove it.
	Removed.
        
[DONE] "this bottle is blue" <- what to do with blue? 
		The adjectives 'blue', is kept in the d_obj as a single element of the nominal group.
        Method 'adjectives_only()' in sentence.py in class Nominal_Group' returns True in this case.

[DONE] "this bottle is 'next to' the table" -> pre-processing to replace "next to" by "next+to"
[DONE]{Complete By End July}: Running dialog even if ORO is off. Need an exception raised when a connection to ORO is required.

    possibly create add features in sentenceFactory in sentence.py
    
[TODO] Verb Tense. 
[TODO] Negation

    "Take the bottle 'carefully'", what to do with 'carefully'

[TODO] input/output module for supervision
[TODO]{Start Early August} speech synthesis -> stdout | festival
[TODO]{Start Early August} speech recognition -> sphinx?? in simple cases?? pfff...


[ONGOING] verbalizing module to reconstruct a NL sentence

[DONE] input/output module to chat with the robot
[DONE] parsing module for English natural language (NL)
[DONE] resolution of personal references + anaphors
[DONE] resolution noun phrases (= identification of concepts)
[DONE] resolution action verbs
        based on thematic roles
        
[DONE] content analysis (is the sentence a question? a statement?...)
        Done for imperative and statements.
        On process for question
[DONE] glue-ing parsing + resolution + analysis + handling
[DONE] handling of "or" :)

[DONE] pre content-analysis -> "what color is the tape?" -> don't use the color to discriminate
        Actually done from Parser.
        E.g: 'what color is the tape?' provides the following sentence with 'color' held in the field 'aim':
            Sentence("w_question", "color", 
                    [Nominal_Group(['the'],
                                ['tape'],
                                [],
                                [],
                                [])],                                         
                    [Verbal_Group(['be'],
                                [],
                                'present simple',
                                [],
                                [],
                                [],
                                [],
                                'affirmative',
                                [])])
                                
            Statements provided for discrimation:
                ?concept rdf:type Tape .
   

[DONE] Add statement in the ontology: use 'safeAdd' method to avoid the inconsistency 
    see 'http://homepages.laas.fr/slemaign/doc/oro-server/laas/openrobots/ontology/modules/base/BaseModule.html#safeAdd%28java.util.Set%29'
    Create new Module 'Statement_Safe_adder' aiming to add statements in the ontology. 
    It may possibly handle unresolved sentence, and force statement_builder to build additionnal information.
    E.g: 'Jido is a robot'. Here, Jido might be discriminate, but not Robot.
    Although statement_builder can easily provide [id_jido rdf:type Robot], this would not be done as the sentence in unresolved yet.


[DONE] Processing the demonstrative 'this' 



Interface
---------

[ONGOING] Improve the output of the dialog module (including colors) to make clear what append (especially for demos):
  * First parsing
  * Resolution *relying on perspective taking* + symbolic knowledge
  * Back interaction with the human
  * Re-parsing
  * Generation of final statements
[TODO] Add the possibility to pause the processing to explain step by step what happen
