Dialog TODO list for release 1.0
================================

[DONE] - input/output module to chat with the robot
[DONE] - parsing module for English natural language (NL)
- sentence pre-processing (punctuation, term expansion, capital letters...)
[PARTIALLY DONE]- verbalizing module to reconstruct a NL sentence
[DONE] - resolution of personal references + anaphors
[DONE] - resolution noun phrases (= identification of concepts)
[DONE BASED ON thematic_roles] - resolution action verbs
[DONE FOR IMPERATIVE SENTENCES] - content analysis (is the sentence a question? a statement?...)
[ON GOING] - statement builder (convert a parsed sentence into RDF statements)
- question handler (for question, try to answer them with ORO)
[DONE] - glue-ing parsing + resolution + analysis + handling
- input/output module for supervision

- Clarify which members of sentence are list, which are single element.
For instance, sn.noun is a list. if we have several nouns (like in "toto and 
tata"), it would be maybe easier to create new sn instead of adding nouns.
- Sort out the "flags": at least, convert it to a map, maybe, remove it.
