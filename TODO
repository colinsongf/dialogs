Dialog TODO list for release 1.0
================================

Bugs
----

- sentence pre-processing (punctuation, term expansion, capital letters...)
- Turn everything to English
- Clarify which members of sentence are list, which are single element.
For instance, sn.noun is a list. if we have several nouns (like in "toto and 
tata"), it would be maybe easier to create new sn instead of adding nouns.
- Sort out the "flags": at least, convert it to a map, maybe, remove it.
- "close the loop" -> parser should be able to complete a previously, partially 
resolved, sentence.
- "this bottle is blue" <- what to do with blue? (see unit-test test_sentence3)
- "this bottle is 'next to' the table" -> pre-processing to replace "next to" by "next+to"
