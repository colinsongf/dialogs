unambiguous descriptions of concepts when answering questions.

                                                   * performedBy red_apple,
                                                   * involves blue_tree]
        
        
        Apples grow on tree --> [id_grow rdf:type Grow,
                                id_grow performedBy owl:AllValuesOf(Apple),
                                id_grow isOn owl:someOf(Tree)]
        
        or   -----------------> [id_grow rdf:type Grow,
                                id_grow performedBy id_apple,
                                id_grow isOn id_tree, ]
                                + id_tree rdf:type Tree,
                                + id_apple rdf:type Apple]

    EVENT actsOnObject green_banana,
    {EVENT receivedBy red_table}

[TODO] Anaphora (previous sentences memory + selection of nominal group)

[TODO] Explain how Dialog deals (or not) with "context"
-> where context is used (-> connection with ontology), where it is missing (eg "I'm going to Toulouse" can be right now or in 2 months. If we know we are talking about the Patrick's holidays next week, it would be clear)
[TODO] list which questions are handled by question handler
