Dialog TODO list for release 1.0
================================

Bugs
----

- sentence pre-processing (punctuation, term expansion, capital letters...)
- Turn everything to English
[DONE]- Clarify which members of sentence are list, which are single element. 
	Everything is a list, except 
	sentence.data_type, 
	sentence.aim, 
	sentence.sv.state,
	sentence.sv,vrb_tense,
	nominal_group.id
	nominal_group._resolved
	nominal_group._and_or
	
	If we have several nouns, e.g "toto" and "tata", we create a new nominal group, even though this results to several single-element lists.

[ON GOING]- Sort out the "flags": at least, convert it to a map, maybe, remove it.
	In the new version of statement builder, the parameter "flags" has been removed.
	After implementing Question Handler, we'll probably remove them all.
	
- "close the loop" -> parser should be able to complete a previously, partially 
resolved, sentence.
- "this bottle is blue" <- what to do with blue? (see unit-test test_sentence3)
		The adjectives blue, will be sent to the nominal group that
- "this bottle is 'next to' the table" -> pre-processing to replace "next to" by "next+to"

Features
--------

[DONE] - input/output module to chat with the robot
[DONE] - parsing module for English natural language (NL)
[PARTIALLY DONE]- verbalizing module to reconstruct a NL sentence
[DONE] - resolution of personal references + anaphors
[DONE] - resolution noun phrases (= identification of concepts)
[DONE BASED ON thematic_roles] - resolution action verbs
[DONE FOR IMPERATIVE SENTENCES] - content analysis (is the sentence a question? a statement?...)
[ON GOING] - statement builder (convert a parsed sentence into RDF statements)
- question handler (for question, try to answer them with ORO)
[DONE] - glue-ing parsing + resolution + analysis + handling
- input/output module for supervision
- speech synthesis -> stdout | festival
- speech recognition -> sphinx?? in simple cases?? pfff...
- pre content-analysis -> "what color is the tape?" -> don't use the color to 
discriminate
- handling of "or" :)


Interface
---------

- Improve the output of the dialog module (including colors) to make clear
what append (especially for demos):
  * First parsing
  * Resolution *relying on perspective taking* + symbolic knowledge
  * Back interaction with the human
  * Re-parsing
  * Generation of final statements
- Add the possibility to pause the processing to explain step by step what
happen
