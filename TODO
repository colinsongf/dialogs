Dialog TODO list for release 1.0
================================

Bugs
----
[TODO] method 'check(Set)' on server always returns 'True'
    Useful for questionHandler for processing Yes-No question

[ONGOING] "close the loop" -> parser should be able to complete a previously, partially resolved, sentence.
    with method remerge in sentence.py
    
[DONE] sentence pre-processing (punctuation, term expansion, capital letters...)
[DONE] Turn everything to English
[DONE] Clarify which members of sentence are list, which are single element. 
    map: [A] means list of A
	Sentence (data_type, aim, sn, sv):
		data_type:	string	
		aim:		string
		sn: 		[Nominal_Group]
		sv:	    	[Nominal_Group]
	
	Nominal_Group(det, noun, adj, noun_cmpl, relative):
		det:		[string]
		noun:		[string]
		adj:		[string]
		noun_cmpl:	[Nominal_Group]
        relative:   [sentence]
        
    Verbal_Group(vrb_main, sv_sec, vrb_tense, d_obj, i_cmpl, advrb, vrb_adv, vrb_sub_sentence, state):
        state:              string
        vrb_tense:          string
        vrb_main:           [string]
        advrb:              [string]
        vrb_adv:            [string]
        d_obj:              [Nominal_Group]
        i_cmpl:             [Indirect_Object([string], [Nominal_Group])]
        sv_sec:             [Verbal_Group]
        vrb_sub_sentence:   [sentence]
        

	
	Also: If we have several nouns, e.g "toto" and "tata", we create a new nominal group, even though this results to several single-element lists.

[DONE] Sort out the "flags": at least, convert it to a map, maybe, remove it.
	Removed.
        
[DONE] "this bottle is blue" <- what to do with blue? 
		The adjectives 'blue', is kept in the d_obj as a single element of the nominal group.
        Method 'adjectives_only()' in sentence.py in class Nominal_Group' returns True in this case.

[DONE] "this bottle is 'next to' the table" -> pre-processing to replace "next to" by "next+to"
[DONE]{Complete By End July}: Running dialog even if ORO is off. Need an exception raised when a connection to ORO is required.


Features
--------
[TODO]{prioritized - Complete By End July}: Resolving anaphora "it" "one"
[TODO]{Complete By End July}: Return a sentence towards verbalization
    possibly create add features in sentenceFactory in sentence.py

[TODO]{Complete By mid-August} subclassOf:
    E.g: Apples are Fruits
    
[TODO]{Complete By mid-August} Nombre    
[TODO]{Complete By mid-August} Verb Tense. 
[TODO]{Complete By mid-August} Negation
    differentOf
    complementOf
    
[TODO]{Complete By mid-August} Process adverbs
    
[TODO]{Complete By mid-August} Quantifier
    add quantifier
	any - 
	some - 
	all - 
	a digit - 
	None E.g Negation on nominal group differents from sv.state
    if determiner is 'a' do not resolve. E.g Jido is a robot => id_jido rdf:type Robot
    "Take the bottle 'carefully'", what to do with 'carefully'

[TODO] Processing the demonstrative 'this' 
    'this is a blue table'
    Use quantifier 'a' to complete statement
    
[TODO] input/output module for supervision
[TODO]{Start by mid-August} speech synthesis -> stdout | festival
[TODO]{Start by mid-August} speech recognition -> sphinx?? in simple cases?? pfff... sphinx version 4

[ONGOING] verbalizing module to reconstruct a NL sentence
[ONGOING] statement builder (convert a parsed sentence into RDF statements)

    what to do with how long/big/small => nothing
    forget How-question

        Done for imperative and statements.
        On process for question
[DONE] glue-ing parsing + resolution + analysis + handling
[DONE] handling of "or" :)

[DONE] pre content-analysis -> "what color is the tape?" -> don't use the color to discriminate
        Actually done from Parser.
        E.g: 'what color is the tape?' provides the following sentence with 'color' held in the field 'aim':
            Sentence("w_question", "color", 
                    [Nominal_Group(['the'],
                                ['tape'],
                                [],
                                [],
                                [])],                                         
                    [Verbal_Group(['be'],
                                [],
                                'present simple',
                                [],
                                [],
                                [],
                                [],
                                'affirmative',
                                [])])
                                
            Statements provided for discrimation:
                ?concept rdf:type Tape .
   
[DONE] Statement to represent disjunction 'or' and conjunction 'and'?
    specify the process of 'or' as a limit of the input of Dialog module
    
[DONE] Add statement in the ontology: use 'safeAdd' method to avoid the inconsistency 
    see 'http://homepages.laas.fr/slemaign/doc/oro-server/laas/openrobots/ontology/modules/base/BaseModule.html#safeAdd%28java.util.Set%29'
    Create new Module 'Statement_Safe_adder' aiming to add statements in the ontology. 
    It may possibly handle unresolved sentence, and force statement_builder to build additionnal information.
    E.g: 'Jido is a robot'. Here, Jido might be discriminate, but not Robot.
    Although statement_builder can easily provide [id_jido rdf:type Robot], this would not be done as the sentence in unresolved yet.
    
    - safeAddForAgent??
	not on statementBuilder


Interface
---------

[ONGOING] Improve the output of the dialog module (including colors) to make clear what append (especially for demos):
  * First parsing
  * Resolution *relying on perspective taking* + symbolic knowledge
  * Back interaction with the human
  * Re-parsing
  * Generation of final statements
  
  * simple GUI
[TODO] Add the possibility to pause the processing to explain step by step what happen
  see 

Report
--------------
[TODO]{Start Early August} write report on trac wiki
    write in wiki syntax in TXT file, add in folder doc
    * analyse general module
    * Input, output
    * Formal description of features
    * How: - No lines of code
    A good formalized draft should be done by mi-august
